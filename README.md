# hello-world
Just following instructions. Anyway, this is probably where you can find what I have.
Been asked to type something on here as part of the learning process. 
When I first got here, we werent taught how to even use Git. 
We were just showed the important buttons and they were like, go do this work that weve somehow assigned to you on the thing we just introduced to you.
And dont touch the main.
